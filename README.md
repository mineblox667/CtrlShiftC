# CtrlShiftC
Press CtrlShiftC to search anything on google. Coded in AutoHotKey, download the .exe file and if you want the source code its the .ahk file. If you want it to start on startup do windows + r, type in "shell:startup", create a shortcut for CtrlShiftC.exe and drag it in that folder. I have optimized the .exe with my secret krabby patty formula to make it so that it doesnt interfere with your system resources and even ive tested it on my intel i3 8gb ram laptop, and it doesnt even do anything exept the ctrlshiftc thing.
